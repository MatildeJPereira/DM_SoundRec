Sound recommendation system.
What exaclty am I doing with this:
        I want to use librosa for the sound analysis part: https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html
        There's some information on how to use it in a way that is useful to get the information I need for the mining part
    itself
        For the dataset I'm thinking of using FMA (Free Music Archive) as it's very complete, I'm still somewhat split
    between using librosa to get my own features or using already made feature matrix, with FMA I can use both.
        I wanted to start with clustering for different features (do not know wich ones yet)
        Also wanted to use Apriori to find things in common between two tracks
        With this I'm somewhat sure I can get an ok working song recommendation system.
